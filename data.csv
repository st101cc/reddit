LSE accomodation for couples,"Hi! 

I will be moving with my partner to London and I was looking for couples' accommodation at LSE. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see there's no availability at all, except for 1 room. Could this be correct? Does anyone know if new accommodation possibilities for couples will appear as we get closer to the start of the new academic year?

Or is this a very risky thing to do and I should not book at all? I would assume it is easy given high demand for the rooms, but I wouldn’t want to end up ending having to pay the whole rent while I live somewhere else. At the same time if I don’t book now, there may not be anything available later, and if I do go to LSE, I would really want to live there. Any advice?",2

opinions on lse,"hi. i’ve been admitted to lse as an undergrad for IR this year and i wanted some clarifications from current students to help me make my decision. 

there’s no doubt lse is the best decision i’ve received in terms of reputation and rank. but i’m not sure if it’s a good fit for me. 

if i’m someone who likes a close knit community feel (i always wanted a campus uni), hands-on, high quality teaching, and room to focus on extracurriculars— could lse be the place for me? 
i’ve heard these are the domains where it can fall short.

Does reinstating my application for the next admissions cycle hurt my chances at financial support?," Hello all,

I  received an offer of admission to the MSc in Economics program at LSE  on January 26. I then submitted the Graduate Support Application around  mid-February. However, I did not receive a Graduate Support Scheme  Award. I was told I would be considered for other scholarships available  but I figure it's too late now.

If  I reinstate my application for the next admissions cycle, would it in  any way hurt my chances at financial support? Is there any point in  trying again?

Thanks!",3
LSE vs UCL vs Warwick PPE,"Hi all, I'm in a very fortunate position and have offer from Warwick, UCL and LSE to study PPE. I'm now deciding on where to firm. 

I've researched a lot about LSE and heard from students about what it's like there. Although I'm aware it's the most prestigious out of the three for my subjects and has the best 'brand', I'm not sure it's a place I'd be happy and would thrive. Hence I am weighing up the pros and cons of the three unis. 

If anyone can give their thoughts to a few of these questions I'd be very grateful:

How is the PPE course at LSE for any students studying (in terms of intensity, course, teaching, cohort etc).

How is the social life at LSE compared to UCL or Warwick - will it be significantly less enjoyable? I've heard the immense work load, competitive environment, lack of community and cliqueness creates a poor student atmosphere. This is quite an important factor to me. 

How large would the difference in graduate prospects between the three universities really be? Will going to Warwick mean I'll have less doors open to me should I have gone to UCL or LSE? I recognise for IB LSE trumps the other clearly, but for consulting or law for example will LSE place me at a significantly larger advantage than if I were to attend UCL or Warwick. I want to keep a steady eye on the future. 

These assumptions are all gathered from speaking to students and reading online, I'm very open to being corrected about anything. 

Sorry for the long post :)",15

"a genuine concern. Or overthinking idk (GSS), bear with me:","I applyed for GSS, yet being an international student my need is higher than the max limit of GSS, so my main aim was the financial aid personal statement to be considered for other LSE scholarships.

 I noticed that there were bugs in the application form when I pressed the check button before I submit, specefic responses were not save even tho I answered them (questions where it tells you to choose yes first then change it to no for it to be saved for example)

The thing is the personal statement section had a note to ""click save twice to save"", I was out of the system a couple times and don't remeber if I pressed save twice :) 

Now I am concerned that it was not sent, should I contact financial support office to check on this issue?

Got into MSc EME!,"Putting down some info in case it might be helpful for future applicants.

I applied just after finishing my BEc at UNSW with an 86 WAM. In my first two years I took mostly economics courses with a bit of psychology, finance, and engineering sprinkled in. In my third year I took mostly mathematics courses, including linear algebra, statistical theory, and real and functional analysis. My GRE was 169Q/168V.

Extracurricular-wise, I had no society involvement but worked as a research assistant for a couple professors as well as a tutor in a third-year course. I sourced two of my three references from my supervisors on these roles!

I followed this structure for my personal statement:
1. The issue I care about
2. The framework I have for tackling this issue
3. How LSE will help me achieve my goal
4. How I plan to continue after LSE
5. Why I’m ready for LSE

Chance me for the Social and Cultural Psychology MSc Program?,"Hi, I recently finished my BA in psychology and I want to go to grad school to get my masters and likely eventually a PhD. Social and cultural psychology were always my two favourite psych topics in school and there seems to be a lot of professors who share the same research interests as me so I would love to be in this program. I know that LSE is a prestigious school so I was hoping to get some insight as to how my chances might be of getting accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Education: Graduated from the University of British Columbia in November 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts, major in psychology and minor in economics. Graduated with high distinction (which here means above 85% in the past 2 years)

GPA: 81.3% cumulatively at UBC (we don't do GPA here just percentages), I went to a small university for some time beforehand with a cumulative GPA of 2.98 (4.33 scale) but I don't know what my exact grade average across all undergrad courses would be (somewhere around 80% or a bit lower I assume). I struggled quite a bit in my early years at UBC but made the Dean's List in 2021 and had Dean's List level grades last year. At the smaller, previous university I had very lower grades but eventually became a Dean's List student there before my grades fell again in the final semester there.

Research experience: I volunteer as a research assistant in 2 psychology labs, one since July and the other since September. Neither of them have included any quantitative work so far though. During school I took courses that gave me training in SPSS, R, and Qualtrics.

Issues: I'm mainly worried about my low grades in my early years, especially in math. Before transferring to UBC I failed 2 math courses (one of which I later took and got a B which replaced the earlier grade but the fail is still on my transcript) and my 2 calculus courses I received 65% and 69%. In my later years I took a few stats courses and got 88%, 88%, and 90% in those. I'm proud of my marks in my final years but my earlier years were quite up and down and while there were mostly As and Bs, there's still the two Fs, a D, and a couple Cs in there. I'm just worried those marks are going to make me look bad even though in my upper years I largely did very well.

The program's webpage includes the amount of applicants (207) and the intake (31) but I would assume the actual amount of people that were given offers was probably higher than 31, but still I don't know how good my chances are. Would love some insight. Thank you!!",1

Is 3.6 GPA good enough for LSE?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a US citizen who just applied for LSE's Economic Policy for International Development (First Choice) and Development Studies (Second Choice). My GPA is 3.68, I have professional experience organizing for a national political campaign, and my undergraduate degree is in International Relations at an average university in Texas. I don't have economic experience but I made it clear in my personal statement I've done my own personal studying in economics. I tried to make clear my passion and personal hard work on the subject of development. Do you think any of this is enough to possible get it? I tried to apply as soon as I could to better my chances too. There's no GRE or degree requirement for the program but some sort of quantitative experience was wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance if you answer",3

Accelerationism UK Student Group &amp; Cybernetic Culture Research Unit,"Hi everyone, based on your past responses it looks like many students in the UK are interested in the [CCRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic_Culture_Research_Unit). I propose that we form a student group open to uni students in the UK to discuss CCRU-related topics such as accelerationism, techno-capitalism, capitalist realism... We could also organise watch parties for [Adam Curtis' work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis) ([HyperNormalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation) &amp; [Can't Get You Out of My Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head_(TV_series))), or [Burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_(musician)) listening parties and discussions.

Matsers vs bachelors .,"Hello im a current sixth form student debating between an economics related degree for the finance world or a computer science degree , most of my choices are for economics related things ie ,econ and politics at LSE ,but i think if i got a undergrad from LSE and then tried to do a CS masters (cos doing 2 bachelors is a waste) would be kind of impossible .So i suppose what im trying to ask is ,is getting a master for something econ related at LSE easier than applying for a bachelors ? Im asking this simply because while i like finance i also like the money but i doubt it will outweigh the corporate life i kinda hate, i was only planning on doing finance for a few years tbh and maybe start something , at the same time i like CS simply because it seems more creative ,but as i have a much less comparative experience in it i cant be making such claims ,also if i moved to a different country i would count as a skilled worker and given priority which i doubt i will get with a lse degree .",0

Gap Year Ideas,"Hi all,

My understanding is that LSE asks to include any plans/activities completed over a gap year, however i'm slightly struggling in finding something meaningful and affordable to include into my personal statement. 

I've had a look at the LSE 'Summer Schools' and whilst they seem like something ideal to write about, but unfortunately its just way too expensive. 

Obviously this depends on the degree in mind but for someone looking at History/EconHistory there's not a great deal one can do other than Essay competitions, open courses etc. 

I've had a quick search of possible internships/insight days but for the most part, they all seem to be targeting undergrads.

If anyone could provide suggestions I would really appreciate it :)",1

LSE Master's admissions,"Hi! This is my first ever post on Reddit :)

I'm confused by LSE's graduate admissions deadlines - which I understand are 'rolling'.

From their website: ""Early applications have a greater chance of being successful and of meeting financial support/scholarship and visa deadlines. Only a few programmes have deadlines by which you should apply – decisions are mostly made on a rolling basis, which means that a programme will close once all of the available places have been filled. You must therefore check the [current availability](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Available-programmes) of your chosen programme(s) and submit your application early to give yourself the best chance of obtaining a place.'

On one part of the website, it says applications are accepted September to September and another says they open in October. Which is it?

For context, I'm hoping to apply to the MSc International Relations!

When is the best time for me to apply? Any advice is appreciated :)",3

Graduate Diploma,"Hello, 

So I have an unconditional offer for an MSc programme this year. I have already finished my bachelor in 2019 and I was doing a graduate diploma by distance learning from 2021-22. I have sent them official transcripts from my undergraduate programme and current grades from the diploma (unfinished) and have received an email with confirmation of my offer.
However, due to various personal reasons, I haven’t been able to attempt all the exams of this diploma so they have been pushed for reassessments which will take place when my LSE degree is ongoing. 

Now I know that I can’t be enrolled in two places at the same time so I have been thinking about dropping this graduate diploma and sending the official confirmation to graduate admissions office. 

Do you think it’ll pose any risk in taking up my place at LSE?

LSE MPP Questions,"Hello! I am a US citizen looking to get an MPP at LSE or Oxford. My top choice is LSE because I want to live in London, but I'm curious of other people's opinions.

I graduated undergrad in 2021, and I had various internships and I work full time now, but I'm not sure it will amount to 5 years by the time I apply (I want to apply this cycle). Has anyone had experience being accepted with less than 5 years experience? 

I am also curious about the possibility of financial aid. I know the GSS ranges from five thousand to fifteen thousand pounds, but what has been people's experience receiving aid? I can go into specifics of my financial situation if needed. Finally, have other international students had good luck getting into the LSE housing? I'm hoping to live in either the High Holborn Residences or the Lillian Knowles House.

I was also wondering about salary, as going through some data, I'll see some postgraduates receiving anywhere between £31,000  and £53,000. I'm sure these data are largely representative of those who get a job in the UK, but I was curious if those numbers remained consistent for those that came to the States with a Master's.

As of now only King's Cross remains available to book out of the LSE halls, and in comparison to other options it seems quite expensive for me, so I am hesitant to get a contract there.

Would there be a way to still get a spot in a cheaper hall at this moment? eg. Is there places where people are selling unwanted contracts for these halls? Do spots become available near results day once some people are rejected?

I am already aware that intercollegiate halls and private housing are also options. Is it less preferable being in private housing or intercollegiate compared to the LSE halls?

Does the school facilitate student led activities, do they implement any measures for greater integration between students? Do the seniors and juniors know one another, and what's the relationship between different cohorts like? I guess in general I'd just like to know if the school does anything for students in terms of like socialisation and integration and assimilation or is it really just up to each person? 

Also, are the various clubs and societies tight knit?",5

Update to waiting for decades + advice for future applicants to LSE!,"Hi! I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLse/comments/uhhwty/feel_like_ive_been_waiting_for_decades_advice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a while back about feeling like I’ve waited decades for a decision from LSE and I wanted to update here so that future applicants may be able to get a better idea of what the timeline looks like. 

This morning I was rejected after 231 days of waiting, having submitted my application in mid-September 2021. From the [application spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXJUK7ddm_UGruvU9sUs-wyTqNSGCKt2MndO6G9la0s/edit) (which was very helpful to chart progress, I thank the creator!), today was the mass rejection for the Geography department, just 13 days before the UCAS deadline for universities to reply on 19 May. 

To all those chancing upon this post in the future, I don’t want this to come off as overly pessimistic! I know that offers for Geography were being given out even in the week I was rejected, and if you look at the spreadsheet retrospectively you will see that LSE has probably given out offers until the deadline (my guess as of right now). 

Honestly, did I expect the rejection? Not really. I was predicted 5 A*s including a relevant EPQ, so it just goes to show that your personal statement matters a lot! Please remember to tailor it as closely as possible to your course’s description on LSE’s website and hope for the best, because at such high competition, it truly is a function of a little bit of luck as well! 

I will be firming UCL and probably insuring Warwick, and I’m very happy with my choices! A lesson to future applicants — always have schools that you love in your list of 5 as you may not get your top school (or even your top schools). 

Overall, hope this post has been useful for whoever’s reading this! And all the best who are taking our exams soon :)",13

It’s been 7 months since I sent in my application and many people have been saying that it’s an instant rejection now since it’s so close to the deadline.

UCL vs LSE,"I've just completed a bachelor's degree in Economics, and now I'm deciding between a MSc in Environmental Economics and Climate Change (LSE) and a MSc in Economics and Policy of Energy and Environment (UCL).
The courses are quite similar: the LSE one is slightly more quantitative (which I don't mind) while the UCL one obviously gives more space to energy topics. 
The tuition fee is almost identical.
UCL seems to be higher in rankings overall, but for economics specifically LSE is well above.

i'm looking to do Sessions 1 and 2, which is around 1.5 months total. of my options i was originally looking to do Sidney Webb since it was the cheapest and had a gym. but i've read the reviews on the actual building and neighborhood was questionable, so now i have some doubts.

Passfield seems to have a comparable price, but is much closer and seems to have more to do in the area, however the only rooms left are with shared bathrooms, which i don't really want to do.

i wasn't initially considering High Holborn before but from the looks of it it does in fact seem like the best of all worlds, just a little hesitant about the price.

Graduate Support Scheme Rejected?,"I am from a poor family and I cannot afford the fees even though I have an offer I know I'll get. I just did the GSS application and it got instantly rejected (I know it's automated). Why? What did I do wrong? Can I appeal it? It's so unfair that I should not be allowed to study at the uni I've wanted to be at for the last 4 years because I'm from a working-class background. I don't get it, how was I rejected? I cannot afford to do my master's now and my whole future is fucked.",9
12 Month MSc Programme and Accommodation,I got an offer to do a 12-month masters programme in the department for Gender studies. I understand that a 12-month programme has an extended Summer term from May to September. I was wondering if I still needed to be on campus throughout this period? I have checked the individual units and it seems that teaching is either during the Michaelmas or Lent terms. If anyone could help out that would be great as I need to get accommodation sorted and most contracts are for about 40 weeks. Thank you :),2
Question: International Social &amp; Public Policy w/ Politics Personal Statement,"I applied to LSE this year on the Jan 26th deadline, for the Int. Social and Public Policy w/ Politics course. I also applied to UCL and King's but for Politics and IR at UCL, and Politics at King's. My personal statement was mainly focused on politics, with some mentions and references to policy as they're heavily intertwined, but I focused on politics as two of my choices' main focus was politics. Now, I'm sort of freaking out because LSE seems to be very intense about the PS being relevant to the major part of the course. LSE is where I'd like to go most as the program interests me a lot and I want to go into HR law in the future. UCL would be great too, followed by KCL being my last choice. 

but I'm very concerned now as I know my PS was quite strong but maybe not relevant enough to social and public policy? Does anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences? I know there's nothing to be done now but just a bit concerned.",2
"Global Politics, Conflict Studies, and Funding","hey all,

I recently got accepted into Global Politics, and I have Conflict Studies as my 2nd option. I am wondering if anyone here has experience with the Global Politics and/or Conflict Studies master's courses? I put the former as my first option because the examination style of the main module suited me better, but idk how the module itself is considered with regards to whether I take it or whether I try for Conflict Studies. I am thinking more so that I will stay on Global Politics, but I am interested in what you all think.

My main problem with both is funding. I come from a poor, working-class family, and I can not even begin to imagine paying £26,000 by myself. I am going to apply for a scholarship, but I am wondering if anyone has any experience with the application process, how easy it is to get accepted, and how helpful it was for you?

I'm not really sure what I want to do after the master's. Going into research is the most appealing option to me now (been recommended it by multiple people who think I'd be good at it) but I'm not totally certain yet.

I also have an acceptance from KCL for Pol and Econ of the ME (still waiting on War Studies + Conflict Studies), which is a lot cheaper, but not quite as well reputable and, more importantly, the modules look a lot more interesting to me at LSE, but if I can't afford LSE then...

LSE based halls vs Intercollegiate vs Private accoms,"Hey guys! Would love to hear your advice re accommodations for first year students undergrad.

There are pros and cons with all and would love to hear your (and your peer) experiences with either of these, and what you would advice for first years. 

LSE based: - LSE community, able to make more LSE friends - more close knit? - closer to school - don't get to meet people beyond / cliques

Intercollegiate: - meet students from ucl kcl etc - further - more party vibes - friendships aren't as close? 

Private accoms: definitely safer given the pandemic situation - potentially nearer - facilities better - less social/ making new friends but I heard societies do the same job

I've also read that EME is the hardest master's and requires a LOT of studying. I'm thinking about changing my application to EME and Econ (in that order) but it's hard to decide without seeing just how hard EME is, so I'd like to see some past papers.

I chose Maths &amp; Statistics for my 2nd year option and Econometrics II for one of my 3rd year options at Cambridge Econ BA, already a v. mathematical course, but apparently EME is harder even than Cambridge MPhil and MRes, so I'd really like to see some past papers to see if it's worth committing (especially since I'm not even fixed on PhD, I just like maths).

"Marxism, History of the Left, Reading Group with the Platypus Society","Hi everyone! The LSESU Platypus Society this year is hosting its usual activities including a weekly reading group on Marxism and the history of the Left. You’re all welcome and no prior knowledge is required! 

We also host public fora such as panels and teach-ins, and informal meet-ups to discuss the contemporary Left. 

Please get in touch if you’re interested. You can comment below, message me, or check out the SU page: 

https://www.lsesu.com/activities/societies/society/11880/

I can add you to a WhatsApp and discuss plans for the coming year. Here’s our Facebook page too! 

https://www.facebook.com/PlatypusLSESU/

Before LSE term begins we’re hosting an online UK-wide reading group via Zoom. That’s being done before we branch off and get some local campus level activity going. Check out our syllabus: 

https://platypus1917.org/2021/08/02/uk-online-marxist-reading-group-2021/

Autumn-Winter 2021

• **Radical Bourgeois Philosophy** (also as a preliminary) - Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Abbé Sieyès, Benjamin Constant, and Adam Smith

• **What is the Left? and What is Marxism?** - Marx, Engels, Lukács, Korsch, Kolakowski, Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse

Winter-Spring 2022: 

• **Introduction to Revolutionary Marxism** - Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky, Lukács, Friedrich Pollock, Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Adorno, The Spartacist League, J.P. Nettl, and Cliff Slaughter

The readings are comprehensive and encompass the origins of the Left in high bourgeois philosophy, the recognition of capitalism as the self-contradiction of society (via Marx), and the rise and crisis of the fin de siècle mass socialist parties as they passed into the 20th century. 

Platypus is seeking to ask the questions: what was the Left, what has happened to it, and what might it be again?

"Should I apply? [International undergraduate, scholarship required]","Hello,

I am a student from Bangladesh, just done with my A-Levels and currently on a gap year. I want to apply to universities around the world, and LSE was one of my top choices throughout. 

However, as I received the results on 12th August and enquired 'people' about it, the whole feedbacks were very very negative and bullying towards me. I got **AABb** (Maths, Physics, English Lit and AS Chem respectively).   
Other than that, I have a very... above-average ECA profile (I guess) and my country is also very under-represented in LSE.   


Do you think I should even consider applying? My target courses ask for AAA-AAB in A-Levels. Other than that, if I eventually apply AND get in - can I get any scholarships/Undergrad Support Scheme support?

1) What do the admission committee put most emphasis on - Personal Statements/LORs/GPA/GRE scores?

2) Should the personal statement focus solely on academics?

3) Do people with work experience get preference for MPA admissions?

4) The university website states that GRE is not a prerequisite for admission. However, I have heard that GRE scores help in securing scholarships. Is that true?

5) How difficult it is for an international student to get a scholarship?

6) I don't have any co curriculars in my CV that would relate to the field that I'm applying to. Would that lessen my chance of getting into LSE?

[POSTGRADUATE] I've been waiting over two months and I still don't have my CAS number. Is this normal?,"I'm a student from the US and I graduated with my bachelor's degree this May. I've been awaiting my CAS number for the past two months and I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same boat.

In the last week of May, I sent my transcript to Graduate Admissions so I could make my offer unconditional. A day after I sent my transcript, I received this email:

""*Dear \[NAME\],*

*I am writing to confirm that we have recently received the following item(s):*

* *Transcript*

*The following documentation and/or condition(s) are still outstanding:*

* ***You must provide official proof of the full title, awarding institution, final overall grade and date of award of each of your qualifications. This information may appear on your transcript.***
* *You are required to obtain your degree with a minimum GPA of 3.5 out of 4.*

*You will not be able to complete enrolment until you have satisfied the documentation requirement(s) and/or condition(s) listed above. We will carry out final checks on all documents when your offer becomes unconditional.*

*If you have recently sent any of the outstanding items listed above, you do not need to contact the office to report that you have sent them. We will write to you again as soon as we have processed them. You will receive a final confirmation email once we have processed all the outstanding items. To see when this will be, please check our* [*current processing times*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/News/Current-processing-times)*.*

*If we require you to provide official documents relating to your previous degree(s), please remember that the best way to do this is to ask your previous institution(s) to send us your documents directly, either via email to* [*graduate.documents@lse.ac.uk*](mailto:graduate.documents@lse.ac.uk) *or via an online document-sharing service such as Digitary, eScrip-Safe, Parchment, or Gradintelligence (for HEAR documents).*

*For further information, and access to our online application tracker which will give you full details on the status of your application and any outstanding documentation/conditions, please visit our* [*website*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate)*.*

*Regards,*

*LSE Graduate Admissions Office*""

Since the automated email above informing me that my transcript has been received but not processed, I have not heard anything from Graduate Admissions since. I graduated with satisfactory conditions, as my GPA exceeds 3.5/4.0. Furthermore, all of the information in the bolded part above (full title, awarding institution, final overall grade and date of award of each of my qualifications) appears on my transcript.

Despite this wait, I still do not have my CAS number. I reached out to Graduate Admissions using their email enquiry form (there is no phone line) in July to make sure there were no problems with my transcript, but they are behind on emails and are still answering queries from June.

I am growing very concerned because my flight in mid-September is rapidly approaching, and I cannot begin the visa application process until I have my CAS number. Is anyone else in the same boat, and is this lengthy wait time normal?",2

Help with MSc Finance and Private Equity,"Hello everyone,

I'm a student at a normal university (Coventry University), I am currently going to my last year of Business Administration with a foundation done in Business Management. In my 2nd year, I finished with a 2.1 but I hope to finish with a 1st next year, I was wondering if it is possible to get in at LSE if I finish with a 2.1 (best case would be 1st), and a good GMAT score. Is it possible to study  MSc Finance and Private Equity at LSE while coming from a Business Administration/Management degree at a less prestigious university?

Information needed regarding tuition fees and student loans,"Hi everyone, my girlfriend just got accepted into a masters program in social policy at the LSE. However, there is one caveat, she does not have enough money to cover the tuition fees. Time is running out and I urged her to contact someone at the school or call a few banks and ask them for a student loan. 

Anyways my question for you would be:

Do you know of any bank or organization that provides student loans on such a short notice?

Do you know anything about the situation on the job market? How fast will she be able to pay back her loan? I assume that due to the name of the uni she will not have a lot of problems getting anywhere regardless of the subject?

I know that this might be a offensively stupid question but is it worth the money and effort regarding student loans etc? We both got accepted at the erasmus school of economics in rotterdam, which is a decent university, much cheaper but obviously not on the same level as the LSE. I am of the opinion that the prestige alone would be worth the money, she is still on the fence regarding that matter. 

Anyways a big thank you in advance for your help!",5

I wrote to them a week ago through “Student Enquiries” system but haven’t received any response yet. Need some advice from you people how should I take this? Is this a normal decision waiting time? Should i simply wait for a response/update or is there anything else I could do?

Edit 1: Reached out to Accounting department as suggested by u/Prof-Eevee. As per the email, they don’t have any access to applicant’s status for data protection reasons.",4

Undergraduate deferral,"Hi there,
I just got an offer for BSc Politics and Economics, but it was very late. I was expecting to get rejected as 90% of offers had already been given out, so I planned a gap year. I would still like to do the gap year but wouldn’t mind too much going to university next year. My undergraduate guide says I am allowed to defer by giving an enquiry form of what I hope to do in my gap year. How likely is it that i will be able to defer the offer? Is it only in exceptional circumstances?

Thanks,
E Mouse",6

"Executive MSc Health Economics, Policy, and management or Full-time MSc International Health Policy (Health Economics) at the LSE?"," Hello, I've been in the pharma industry for 4 years now. If I would have the two options, worrying about the money (don't have a scholarship for either of both) which one is best for me?.

Graduate Accommodation Question: Should I do LSE housing or find a private rental with a close friend?,"Hi, I am going to be attending LSE this fall and getting a MSc in Philsoophy and Public Policy. 

I'm from the US, and found out a close friend of mine is also moving to London this fall. Would a better overall experience be to pick graduate housing (for cost reasons + social reasons) or find private housing with my friend? If I get private housing, we would preferably like to live in Zone 1. 

I am open to any opinions/suggestions!

It has been difficult to compare standard private rental costs to LSE accommodation costs, since I am not sure how COVID will affect private rental prices as the year progresses. If anyone has any insight on this, that would be great.

Thanks for the help!",9

To LLM Alumni: What courses did you do and what were your impressions of the teaching staff?,"Hi all,

I've got an LLM offer for September '21 and I'm putting together a list of potential courses. I'm curious to hear about people's experiences and opinions on the courses themselves, as well as the teaching staff.

In particular, I'd like to know:

* What did your LLM look like? General or specialised?
* Which were your favorite modules from it and why?
* Who were your favorite lecturers and why?

In addition, I'd be grateful for any general tips on making the most of the LLM (including dissertation topic selection and how you went about it).

The reason I ask is because I had an up-and-down undergrad experience - course quality really hinged on the module leader's ability and interest in teaching. I want to pursue my interests (mostly finance, tax and international law courses), but I will definitely change things around if the related courses are of questionable quality.

Appreciate the info!",3

I’ve also known a few alumni that left here to go to the grand LSE in the one and only London, and have ultimately ended up back here and unemployed, although they were geniuses and certainly had no intention of coming back.

LSE vs NYU,"Hi all,

I was lucky enough to get into NYU and LSE for grad school. But I can’t make a decision on which one to go for. 

Programs:

NYU - M.A. Psychology (Social and consumer psychology concentration) (2 years)

LSE - MSc Behavioural Science (1 year)

Cost:

Of course NYU is much more expensive. I’m an international student for both universities and wasn’t given financial aid for either. My father has agreed to help me out and is actually willing to finance both degrees. However for NYU, I might need to take out around $10k in loans for living expenses.

Jobs:

I’m actually also looking to see which university will give me better opportunities after graduation. My concentration is consumer behaviour in the fashion industry. I’m looking at fast fashion, buying decisions, and cognitive dissonance within consumers. I’d ideally like to work in the fashion industry promoting sustainability and that’s why I applied to big cities like London and New York.

I never thought I would get into both places but now that I have this decision seems impossible. I feel like New York is just tooo expensive (and also a bit scary?). NYU though seems like a much better university than LSE. Though I have 0 personal experience with both (nor do I know anyone who had studied in either place).

Would really love any sort of advice to help make this decision.",13

What are my chances at the LSE GMiM?,"Hi everyone! I applied a couple weeks ago for the GMiM programme at LSE since it seemed relatively less competitive with 5 people competing for a spot. I have one source of ambiguity in my Profile. While I have an undergraduate degree, for which I only just about make the entry requirements of 2:1 with 61%, it was only a distance degree issued as part of my main qualification. I am a Chartered Accountant from India. This is an very tough course with about 15% pass percentage and my marks are very low (since it’s a pass or fail exam). Thankfully, CA is considered equivalent to a Master’s in the UK. 

I have 3 years of relevant internship experience and 1 year full time experience as a Consultant in a top accounting firm (which is in line with my career aspirations of getting into Management Consulting). I believe my SOP is good, but of course I cannot be sure.

Please tell me if you think I can get in!

How easy is it to change an undergrad course?,"Hello All,

Got accepted for the PPE course few days back, but I really am questioning whether I want to do a course which lasts for 4 years. Furthermore, I am no longer as much interested in politics as I used to be. Moreover, I wish to pursue a PHD in economics with some philosophy. So, I was thinking to do the Philosophy and Economics course instead. This will enable me to spend more time in the respective subjects, whilst also doing some more maths modules with the 'optional' arrangements, as well as saving me a year of education which carries a large opportunity cost.

How do I go about this and informing the LSE staff about my intentions?

Thoughts on Public Policy Analysis Online cert as a first step into public policy and ideally a MPP.,"Hello all,

I'm curious to know about anyone's experience with LSE's Public Policy Analysis Online cert. I graduated from undergrad in the United States about 7 years ago, I have 1YoE in public sector (campaign efforts), 6YoE in private (Silicon Valley and Chinese Tech firms) and I have both a hobby and passion in policy analysis.

That being said, I've made a commitment to pursue this passion and I'm curious to know about anyone's experience with this programme. I've always been fond of LSE. I follow online events and studies released by students and faculty in order to have a better global perspective. I've dreamt about attending such an amazing institution of brilliant minds all converging to grow, learn, and exchange ideas in the international city of London. I am considering this programme as a foundational pivot towards attaining the MPP.

I'm curious to know of any thoughts some may have about the Public Policy Analysis Online programme and the idea of taking this as a precursor into pursuing a full MPP.

Thanks for any input you may have.

Stay safe, and healthy.

At my institution, the maximum amount of courses one can take is 6. (18 credit cap, each course  being 3). I am currently maxed out every semester to graduate on time. Wouldn't studying abroad at LSE set my graduation plan back or am I misunderstanding what an LSE course is by definition?",1

I browsed through google to see if I can find anything useful to help him.

I came across the following article.

Apparently, you could ask LSE to grant you a PHD degree first and submit your thesis 35 years later.

I showed my brother this, and he told me that she is just like Gaddafi's son, another privileged student who bought

her PHD degree.

I tried to convince my brother that a creditable school like LSE will not tolerate such shady behavior.

I told him that LSE will treat every students equally, and he should definitely ask LSE to grant him a doctoral degree.

How do I convince my brother?

How good are the AAA/joint honours courses at LSE? - esp.

Several weaker unis seem to have lower offer rates and similar AAA offers, so am I missing something in the sense that apart from the LSE flagship straight econ course, are other degrees, and this one, much less reputable?   
For example for IB or finance would an economics degree from Loughborough or St.Andrews be more competitive than this one?

And even though the economics is a minor, I assume even the geography will be taught from an economic perspective, so will this be enough to appear competitive for IB and finance?

In addition, would one prioritize 1 of the three over the others in terms of their location (Rosebury is in a different location then Passfield and Carr-Saunders which are mid single-digit blocks away from each other in Fitzrovia, with Passfield enjoying more greenery and situated closer to campus then Carr-Saunders).",6

Just a little rent on the recent decision by Chinese-taipeinese,"  

FYI, an art project in LSE just got political.

To be clear, I’m not a student in LSE, but apparently I belongs to the People’s Republic of China according to your decision. 

The new art project *The World Turned Upside Down* by Mark Wallinger was unveiled on 26th March. On it is a world map that’s upside down. And to no one’s surprise, Chinese students didn’t replied in kind when the artist decided to color Taiwan and China differently. LSE did held a meeting where they made a decision, which was that Taiwan should be in the same color as China, and the label “Republic of China (Taiwan)” should be erased. 

To be clear I respect this decision fully (not that I have any saying in this), but I do like to point out that, according to LSE’s website, the aim of LSE is “For the betterment of society”.  And I would like to be informed that, by helping a political entity erase the fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) exists as a sovereign, how can the society be better?   


Now obviously  I  know I should have  the most minute of saying in this, but nevertheless I still want to say that, in a time when China has been continuously closing in the grip on Taiwan, when China inevitably got its way to Taiwan, it will be the best evidence that our civilization is based on absolute lies. When all of us claims that the decisions we make, the actions we take  are all ""For the betterment of society"", we were clearly fine watching a country notorious for its strike on civil rights taking over a state of freedom.  


Just say'n, while I still got the internet.",6

Economist with a social sciences master,"Hi! I'm a chilean economist. I graduated 8 months ago. I've been working as a research assistant since may/2018 and currently I'm working in consultancy. I have a question regarding masters within social sciences. I have a conditional acceptance letter to study political sociology in LSE, which was my program of choice. I was expecting to study there with the chevening scholarship, but was not selected. The masters cost 17.000 pounds, and that implies, of course, 12 months in London 😥. I have the possibility to obtain a local credit that would finance all the costs, but i don't know if is the right decision, speaking in terms of jobs/ being able to pay the credit. The question would be easier if the master was in finance, but given that is in social sciences, i don't know if is the right decision, financially.

So, would this master worth the investment in your country? As an economist. In Chile, very few people are economists, even less go to LSE, so i don't know how to compare. Even so, a master is starting to become a must in job searching for economists. Personally, i would love to study my master of choice, but my direct family(mother) is poor, so being able to provide them is a must to me.

LSESU Gaming Society," 

Hi Everyone

We are LSE’s home for all things video-games related whether that be casual co-ops, mettle-testing tournaments or stepping stones into the industry. Our termly programme consists of weekly sessions where members are invited to play whatever games they like either using their own gear or the society’s Switch, Xbox One and PC. These regular sessions are interspersed with themed weeks such as pub crawls, in-house competitions for prizes, industry conventions, and of course, “The Games” which challenges teams to battle it out in a series of fiendish challenges and competitions. As an added bonus, we provide subsidies for gaming and eSports events, and access to a wide library of games that save your poor student money.

For those of you with a more competitive streak we’re looking for students to represent LSE nationally in your game of choice whether that be Overwatch, League of Legends, DOTA, or CS:GO (and more) for prizes and prestige. There will of course also be opportunities to play these games casually within the society, if you’re looking for a duo partner or just someone to flame. 

Finally, there are opportunities to develop the links and skills necessary to join the gaming industry. Our annual charity livestream, as well as other events, allow individuals to show off their talents whether they be technical, organisational, social, or anything else. Planned industry events can then offer opportunities to network as well as inspire and develop goals.

American Student looking to apply to schools in the UK. I've read the International Student Qualifications.,"Hello, I am an American Student(undergraduate) looking to apply to LSE and I am bit concerned about my test scores: namely my SAT subject tests and AP tests. In a conditional offer would they let me retake? I might be overthinking it a tiny bit (I'm also a tiny bit stressed). (Thinking of applying to PPE, or if that's not possible, a course in economics, social sciences, history, or politics) Here are my American scores:

So far I have a 32 in ACT 

5 in Macroeconomics

5 in Microeconomics

5 in World History

5 in Art History

5 in AP Government

5 in AB Calc

5 in Psychology

5 in Seminar

4 in BC (im concerned about this, I'm thinking about retaking)

3 in Lang (im concerned about this too, but im submitting a rescore form and I might retake based on those results)

SAT subject scores: 640 in Lit, 730 in Math 2, and 800 in World History (I'm really concerned about these scores, esp the lit one and math 2)

I have 4.0 GPA (I've heard they don't really care about American GPA but I'll list it anyways)

I can list my future APs as well as any relevant extracurriculars if requested as well.

I guess in general I'm curious about what the admissions is really based on. (ex. how big of a percentage is the interview worth in the process?(Is there an interview? I didn't see any on the site) How much is the application based on an individual situation? How much is my SAT/ACT score worth?) Please ask any questions if you aren't clear thanks!

Looking for advise and tips,"Hi everyone,

I know this might not be LSE specific however, considering this is an economics school I was hoping some of you could lend me some advise in the following:

Currently I'm a international student completing my second year at a American university in Biochemistry. However, due to my interests in mathematics and economics as well as my new found strong capabilities in university physics (stronger results than some of the physics majors) my interests have been drifting away from science and into business, economics &amp; finance. This made me think that maybe a Msc in Economics would be the appropriate step to follow. (Also, I do want to get back to the old continent in general :) so I'm thinking of doing this at a U.K. Or European university)

And so, I was hoping to get some advice on what a transition like this would mean, what appropriate steps I should think of taking In terms of coursework and ECs, and where I should direct my focus and time if I want to make this a reality. 

What I came up with at this point is, due to my intense scheduling in the first two years I was able to complete the majority of my major courses, which leaves me a lot of room for a customized further education. I've been considering following up my abilities in physics with a minor (coursework includes: modern physics, electricity and magnetism, thermonuclear and statistical mechanics) and with a finance minor (coursework includes: accounting, financial management, investments, international financial management, and another finance elective). 

However, as I did some research I noticed that most Msc economics courses want a good background in mathematics and intermediate economics. So maybe coursework in those areas would be more appropriate to get to my goal instead of physics and finance? Or should I focus on making sure my GPA is the strongest it can be instead, opting to loosen up my schedule slightly?

Best regards and thanks in advance for any help.

I would assume it is easy given high demand for the rooms, but I wouldn’t want to end up ending having to pay the whole rent while I live somewhere else. At the same time if I don’t book now, there may not be anything available later, and if I do go to LSE, I would really want to live there. Any advice?",3

opinions on lse,"hi. i’ve been admitted to lse as an undergrad for IR this year and i wanted some clarifications from current students to help me make my decision. 

there’s no doubt lse is the best decision i’ve received in terms of reputation and rank. but i’m not sure if it’s a good fit for me. 

if i’m someone who likes a close knit community feel (i always wanted a campus uni), hands-on, high quality teaching, and room to focus on extracurriculars— could lse be the place for me? 
i’ve heard these are the domains where it can fall short.

Does reinstating my application for the next admissions cycle hurt my chances at financial support?," Hello all,

I  received an offer of admission to the MSc in Economics program at LSE  on January 26. I then submitted the Graduate Support Application around  mid-February. However, I did not receive a Graduate Support Scheme  Award. I was told I would be considered for other scholarships available  but I figure it's too late now.

If  I reinstate my application for the next admissions cycle, would it in  any way hurt my chances at financial support? Is there any point in  trying again?

Thanks!",3
LSE vs UCL vs Warwick PPE,"Hi all, I'm in a very fortunate position and have offer from Warwick, UCL and LSE to study PPE. I'm now deciding on where to firm. 

I've researched a lot about LSE and heard from students about what it's like there. Although I'm aware it's the most prestigious out of the three for my subjects and has the best 'brand', I'm not sure it's a place I'd be happy and would thrive. Hence I am weighing up the pros and cons of the three unis. 

If anyone can give their thoughts to a few of these questions I'd be very grateful:

How is the PPE course at LSE for any students studying (in terms of intensity, course, teaching, cohort etc).

How is the social life at LSE compared to UCL or Warwick - will it be significantly less enjoyable? I've heard the immense work load, competitive environment, lack of community and cliqueness creates a poor student atmosphere. This is quite an important factor to me. 

How large would the difference in graduate prospects between the three universities really be? Will going to Warwick mean I'll have less doors open to me should I have gone to UCL or LSE? I recognise for IB LSE trumps the other clearly, but for consulting or law for example will LSE place me at a significantly larger advantage than if I were to attend UCL or Warwick. I want to keep a steady eye on the future. 

These assumptions are all gathered from speaking to students and reading online, I'm very open to being corrected about anything. 

Sorry for the long post :)",16

The thing is the personal statement section had a note to ""click save twice to save"", I was out of the system a couple times and don't remeber if I pressed save twice :) 

Now I am concerned that it was not sent, should I contact financial support office to check on this issue?

Got into MSc EME!,"Putting down some info in case it might be helpful for future applicants.

I applied just after finishing my BEc at UNSW with an 86 WAM. In my first two years I took mostly economics courses with a bit of psychology, finance, and engineering sprinkled in. In my third year I took mostly mathematics courses, including linear algebra, statistical theory, and real and functional analysis. My GRE was 169Q/168V.

Extracurricular-wise, I had no society involvement but worked as a research assistant for a couple professors as well as a tutor in a third-year course. I sourced two of my three references from my supervisors on these roles!

I followed this structure for my personal statement:
1. The issue I care about
2. The framework I have for tackling this issue
3. How LSE will help me achieve my goal
4. How I plan to continue after LSE
5. Why I’m ready for LSE

Chance me for the Social and Cultural Psychology MSc Program?,"Hi, I recently finished my BA in psychology and I want to go to grad school to get my masters and likely eventually a PhD. Social and cultural psychology were always my two favourite psych topics in school and there seems to be a lot of professors who share the same research interests as me so I would love to be in this program. I know that LSE is a prestigious school so I was hoping to get some insight as to how my chances might be of getting accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Education: Graduated from the University of British Columbia in November 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts, major in psychology and minor in economics. Graduated with high distinction (which here means above 85% in the past 2 years)

GPA: 81.3% cumulatively at UBC (we don't do GPA here just percentages), I went to a small university for some time beforehand with a cumulative GPA of 2.98 (4.33 scale) but I don't know what my exact grade average across all undergrad courses would be (somewhere around 80% or a bit lower I assume). I struggled quite a bit in my early years at UBC but made the Dean's List in 2021 and had Dean's List level grades last year. At the smaller, previous university I had very lower grades but eventually became a Dean's List student there before my grades fell again in the final semester there.

Research experience: I volunteer as a research assistant in 2 psychology labs, one since July and the other since September. Neither of them have included any quantitative work so far though. During school I took courses that gave me training in SPSS, R, and Qualtrics.

Issues: I'm mainly worried about my low grades in my early years, especially in math. Before transferring to UBC I failed 2 math courses (one of which I later took and got a B which replaced the earlier grade but the fail is still on my transcript) and my 2 calculus courses I received 65% and 69%. In my later years I took a few stats courses and got 88%, 88%, and 90% in those. I'm proud of my marks in my final years but my earlier years were quite up and down and while there were mostly As and Bs, there's still the two Fs, a D, and a couple Cs in there. I'm just worried those marks are going to make me look bad even though in my upper years I largely did very well.

The program's webpage includes the amount of applicants (207) and the intake (31) but I would assume the actual amount of people that were given offers was probably higher than 31, but still I don't know how good my chances are. Would love some insight. Thank you!!",1

We could also organise watch parties for [Adam Curtis' work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curtis) ([HyperNormalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation) &amp; [Can't Get You Out of My Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head_(TV_series))), or [Burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_(musician)) listening parties and discussions.

As we grow, I propose that we establish CCRU student society at LSE

Matsers vs bachelors .,"Hello im a current sixth form student debating between an economics related degree for the finance world or a computer science degree , most of my choices are for economics related things ie ,econ and politics at LSE ,but i think if i got a undergrad from LSE and then tried to do a CS masters (cos doing 2 bachelors is a waste) would be kind of impossible .So i suppose what im trying to ask is ,is getting a master for something econ related at LSE easier than applying for a bachelors ? Im asking this simply because while i like finance i also like the money but i doubt it will outweigh the corporate life i kinda hate, i was only planning on doing finance for a few years tbh and maybe start something , at the same time i like CS simply because it seems more creative ,but as i have a much less comparative experience in it i cant be making such claims ,also if i moved to a different country i would count as a skilled worker and given priority which i doubt i will get with a lse degree .",0

Gap Year Ideas,"Hi all,

My understanding is that LSE asks to include any plans/activities completed over a gap year, however i'm slightly struggling in finding something meaningful and affordable to include into my personal statement. 

I've had a look at the LSE 'Summer Schools' and whilst they seem like something ideal to write about, but unfortunately its just way too expensive. 

Obviously this depends on the degree in mind but for someone looking at History/EconHistory there's not a great deal one can do other than Essay competitions, open courses etc. 

I've had a quick search of possible internships/insight days but for the most part, they all seem to be targeting undergrads.

If anyone could provide suggestions I would really appreciate it :)",1

LSE Master's admissions,"Hi! This is my first ever post on Reddit :)

I'm confused by LSE's graduate admissions deadlines - which I understand are 'rolling'.

From their website: ""Early applications have a greater chance of being successful and of meeting financial support/scholarship and visa deadlines. Only a few programmes have deadlines by which you should apply – decisions are mostly made on a rolling basis, which means that a programme will close once all of the available places have been filled. You must therefore check the [current availability](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Available-programmes) of your chosen programme(s) and submit your application early to give yourself the best chance of obtaining a place.'

On one part of the website, it says applications are accepted September to September and another says they open in October. Which is it?

For context, I'm hoping to apply to the MSc International Relations!

When is the best time for me to apply? Any advice is appreciated :)",3

Graduate Diploma,"Hello, 

So I have an unconditional offer for an MSc programme this year. I have already finished my bachelor in 2019 and I was doing a graduate diploma by distance learning from 2021-22. I have sent them official transcripts from my undergraduate programme and current grades from the diploma (unfinished) and have received an email with confirmation of my offer.
However, due to various personal reasons, I haven’t been able to attempt all the exams of this diploma so they have been pushed for reassessments which will take place when my LSE degree is ongoing. 

Now I know that I can’t be enrolled in two places at the same time so I have been thinking about dropping this graduate diploma and sending the official confirmation to graduate admissions office. 

Do you think it’ll pose any risk in taking up my place at LSE? 

PS: I have already contacted my department and admissions and they haven’t reached back to me.",1

LSE MPP Questions,"Hello! I am a US citizen looking to get an MPP at LSE or Oxford. My top choice is LSE because I want to live in London, but I'm curious of other people's opinions.

I graduated undergrad in 2021, and I had various internships and I work full time now, but I'm not sure it will amount to 5 years by the time I apply (I want to apply this cycle). Has anyone had experience being accepted with less than 5 years experience? 

I am also curious about the possibility of financial aid. I know the GSS ranges from five thousand to fifteen thousand pounds, but what has been people's experience receiving aid? I can go into specifics of my financial situation if needed. Finally, have other international students had good luck getting into the LSE housing? I'm hoping to live in either the High Holborn Residences or the Lillian Knowles House.

I was also wondering about salary, as going through some data, I'll see some postgraduates receiving anywhere between £31,000  and £53,000. I'm sure these data are largely representative of those who get a job in the UK, but I was curious if those numbers remained consistent for those that came to the States with a Master's.

Undergraduate Accommodation Help,"I'm unsure of what to do right now for my accommodation at LSE.

As of now only King's Cross remains available to book out of the LSE halls, and in comparison to other options it seems quite expensive for me, so I am hesitant to get a contract there.

Would there be a way to still get a spot in a cheaper hall at this moment? eg. Is there places where people are selling unwanted contracts for these halls? Do spots become available near results day once some people are rejected?

I am already aware that intercollegiate halls and private housing are also options. Is it less preferable being in private housing or intercollegiate compared to the LSE halls?

planning to live at bankside as a first year- thoughts?,"hi! i’m an international student who’s going to be a first year starting this fall. i was thinking of getting a room at bankside because the rooms are spacious enough, it seems more social than other halls (i’m an extrovert i need a community to be a part of), it has catered dinners and the walk to LSE is pretty. 

besides from this, i wanted to know, what are the pros and cons of bankside? is it one of the nicer halls? if not, what halls would you recommend?",8

Update to waiting for decades + advice for future applicants to LSE!,"Hi! I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLse/comments/uhhwty/feel_like_ive_been_waiting_for_decades_advice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a while back about feeling like I’ve waited decades for a decision from LSE and I wanted to update here so that future applicants may be able to get a better idea of what the timeline looks like. 

This morning I was rejected after 231 days of waiting, having submitted my application in mid-September 2021. From the [application spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXJUK7ddm_UGruvU9sUs-wyTqNSGCKt2MndO6G9la0s/edit) (which was very helpful to chart progress, I thank the creator!), today was the mass rejection for the Geography department, just 13 days before the UCAS deadline for universities to reply on 19 May. 

To all those chancing upon this post in the future, I don’t want this to come off as overly pessimistic! I know that offers for Geography were being given out even in the week I was rejected, and if you look at the spreadsheet retrospectively you will see that LSE has probably given out offers until the deadline (my guess as of right now). 

Honestly, did I expect the rejection? Not really. I was predicted 5 A*s including a relevant EPQ, so it just goes to show that your personal statement matters a lot! Please remember to tailor it as closely as possible to your course’s description on LSE’s website and hope for the best, because at such high competition, it truly is a function of a little bit of luck as well! 

I will be firming UCL and probably insuring Warwick, and I’m very happy with my choices! A lesson to future applicants — always have schools that you love in your list of 5 as you may not get your top school (or even your top schools). 

Overall, hope this post has been useful for whoever’s reading this! And all the best who are taking our exams soon :)",12
Advice on Teachers Reference for Undergrad Application?,"As part of my undergrad application to LSE for a Bachelor of History and Politics I need to supply a teachers reference, I asked my teacher and he said they generally come from deans or principals. I would prefer it to come directly from my teacher who knows me personally for 2 years now and understands what direction I wanna head in. Is it recommended or necessary to get a teachers reference from a dean or principal? Any advice would be great :)",2
