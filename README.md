# Public Perception of LSE on Reddit

## Analysis on Public Perception Towards LSE on Reddit

### Motivation 
As undergraduate students at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), we want to know what is the publicâ€™s general perception about the university we are currently pursuing our degrees in. Through this project, we hope to understand of how reputable LSE is in the public's eyes, and how a degree from LSE could be beneficial in the workforce.

### Research Question
- What are some common traits that the public associate LSE with?
- What do people on Reddit want to know more about LSE?

The data we used in this project is obtained through the [data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/st101cc/reddit/blob/main/data_acquisition.ipynb) file, and we stored our final founding in the [report.ipynb](https://github.com/st101cc/reddit/blob/main/report.ipynb) file.
